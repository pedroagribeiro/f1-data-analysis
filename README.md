## Purpose

I am a Formula 1 nerd as well as a nerd that feels the need to understand my
passions to the fullest. I have a Computer Science background and would like to
put my long forgotten match and data science skills to the test as well as
udnerstand a bit better the world of engineering that goes into a Formula 1
weekend. In that sense, this projet is an attempt to make sense of the data that
the cars produce and perhaps preview the development cicles of the teams and
some race weekends result tendencies.
